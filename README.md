This application is designed for Linux systems.

### 1. System Dependencies

First, ensure you have `adb` and `scrcpy` installed and available in your system's PATH.

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu based systems
sudo apt update
sudo apt install adb scrcpy
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabreek/python-scrcpylauncher.git

python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

## üé® Custom Icons

One of the key features is the ability to easily customize icons for your apps and games.

* **Android Apps:** If you don't like the icon scraped from the Play Store, simply drag and drop your preferred image file (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.) directly onto the existing icon in the "Apps" tab.
* **Winlator Games:** If the icon extracted from the `.exe` is incorrect or missing, just drag and drop your game's poster or icon onto the placeholder in the "Winlator" tab.

The new icon will be automatically resized, converted to `.png`, and cached for future use.
