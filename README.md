**ATTENTION: This project has been discontinued!** 

Hello everyone,

I would like to inform you that this repository (`python-scrcpylauncher`) will
no longer receive updates or support.

I'm excited to announce the launch of its successor: **qt-yaScrcpy**!

 **qt-yaScrcpy** has been completely rewritten using **PySide6 (Qt)**, resulting
in a much **faster, more modern, and visually superior application**. It retains
all the features you love, but with enhanced performance and stability.

**I strongly recommend all users migrate to the new project.**
You can find the new repository here:
[https://github.com/gabreek/qt-yaScrcpy](https://github.com/gabreek/qt-yaScrcpy)
Thank you for your support of this project, and we look forward to seeing you on
      **qt-yaScrcpy**!


**ATTENTION: This project has been discontinued!**
